# kubech (kubectl change)
Set kubectl contexts/namespaces per shell/terminal to manage multi Kubernetes cluster at the same time.

i.e. same as `kubectx/kubens` but per shell/terminal.

## Why
- If you manage multi K8s clusters, you will need a handy way to work more than one cluster at the same time.
- [kubectx/kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) tools fix this problem but globally,
  that means all shells and terminals will have the same context/namespace.
- However, this is not helpful at all if you are actually working with multi clusters at the same time.
- Thus, `kubech` comes to fix this problem so you can set K8s cluster context/namespace per shell/terminal.

## Features
- Each shell/terminal will have its own context (K8s cluster) or namespace!
- Easy to use! Just source it in your favorite shell.
- It works out of the box! No aliases, no extra customizations,
  it doesn't matter if you work with 1 or 100 K8s clusters!
- It still can be used along with other tools like `kubectx/kubens`.
- It doesn't change anything in `~/.kube/config` file.
  So it works perfectly with static and dynamic kube config files.
- It supports extra kubectl config (in addition to `~/.kube/config`).
- It supports autocomplete for contexts and namespaces.

## Install
Clone this repo, then source `kubech` in your shell config file.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/kubech ~/.kubech
```

### Bash
```
echo 'source ~/.kubech/kubech' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source ~/.kubech/completion/kubech.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
```
### Zsh
Completion for `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh` enabled.
```
echo 'source ~/.kubech/kubech' >> ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/.kubech/completion/kubechn.zsh ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_kubechn.zsh
ln -s ~/.kubech/completion/kubechc.zsh ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_kubechc.zsh
```

Please make sure `autoload -U compinit && compinit` is added to `~/.zshrc` if not please execute below command.
```
echo  'autoload -U compinit && compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage
```
NOTE:
  - The command "kubech" is just a meta for other commands. So kubech does nothing by itself.
  - Also short names like "kchc/kchn/kchu" are available.

VARS:
  KUBECONFIG_SRC_DIR     : Set directory with extra kubectl config files to read in kubech commands.
                           This allow to have multiple config files in addition to
                           the one at "\$HOME/.kube/config".
                           Default: "$HOME/.kube/config.src.d"
  KUBECONFIG_DEST_DIR    : Set directory for temporary kubectl config files. The files
                           in this directory are auto-generated by kubech commands
                           and you don't need to interact with them or even change that var.
                           Default: "$HOME/.kube/config.dest.d"
  KUBECH_NAMESPACE_CHECK : Method used to check if namespace exists before switching to it.
                           The default lists all namespaces which can be slow in large
                           clusters. After kubernetes 1.22+ all namespaces have a label
                           that can be used to speed this up. Set to "label" to enable this.
                           Available options: "list", "label".
                           Default: "list"

USAGE:
  kubechc             : List all contexts
  kubechc <CONTEXT>   : Switch to context <CONTEXT>
  kubechn             : List all namespaces
  kubechn <NAMESPACE> : Switch to namespace <NAMESPACE>
  kubechu             : Unset the active context. This is just a safty net
                        to avoid applying config by mistake to the wrong cluster.
```

### List available contexts
```
$ kubechc
k8s_cluster01
k8s_cluster02
```

### Switch context
No need to write the full name, press tab for auto complete.
```
$ kubechc k8s_cluster01
```

### List available namespaces
```
$ kubechn
default
kube-public
kube-system
monitoring
```

### Switch namespace
No need to write the full name, press tab for auto complete.
```
$ kubechn monitoring
```

## Notes
- This tools has been tested with `bash 4.4` only. However it should work with other shells like `zsh`.
- It's recommended to use this tool with [kube-ps1](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1)
  so current cluster is more visible.
- It's still recommended to have [kubectx/kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)
  to manage contexts/namespaces globally.

## To-do
- Test it with older `bash` versions like bash v3 on MacOS.
